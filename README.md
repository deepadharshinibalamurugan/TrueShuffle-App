# TrueShuffle Pro - Offline Music Player

A modern web-based music player designed to solve the "bad shuffle" problem. Unlike mainstream apps that use pseudo-random algorithms, **TrueShuffle** uses a mathematical approach to ensure zero song repetitions.


##  The Feature: "True Shuffle"
Most apps use algorithms that can play the same song multiple times in a short window. This app implements the **Fisher-Yates Shuffle** algorithm:
- **No Repeats:** Every song in your folder is added to a "deck."
- **Exhaustive Play:** A song is removed from the deck once played.
- **Fair Rotation:** You will not hear the same song again until every single track in your collection has been played.

##  Features
- **Offline First:** Plays music directly from your device storage.
- **Auto-Play:** Seamlessly transitions to the next track in the shuffled queue.
- **Modern UI:** Dark mode interface inspired by professional mobile music apps.
- **Search & Sort:** Easily find tracks in large libraries (200+ songs).
